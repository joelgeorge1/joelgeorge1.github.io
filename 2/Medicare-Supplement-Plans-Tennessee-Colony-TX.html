Medicare MSA Plans mix a high deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a trust or custodial savings account (as defined and/or accredited by the IRS).<p>
<p>And although your enrollment window is seven months long, you need to enroll during the three months prior to your birthday month in order to have coverage that takes effect the first of the month that you simply turn 65.
