<p>Medicare is a national medical insurance program that covers hundreds of thousands of individuals and entails an even higher variety of healthcare providers and providers. If you have missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment period, there's a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 every year. During this other Medicare Open Enrollment interval, you can change from one Medicare Advantage plan to a different, and you may go back to Original Medicare. If you come back to Part A and Part B coverage, you possibly can often enroll in a stand-alone Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan. Keep in thoughts that this Medicare Open Enrollment interval is just for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.<p>
<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a unique Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan.
