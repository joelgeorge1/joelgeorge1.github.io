<p>The only exception is should you’re contributing to a health savings account and wish to continue doing so. Medicare enrollees aren't allowed to contribute to an HSA, even if they proceed to have coverage underneath an employer’s HSA-qualified high-deductible health plan. That mentioned, it typically pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even in case you have health coverage already. It won’t cost you anything, and this manner, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and potentially decide up the tab for anything your main insurance doesn’t cover. If you do not join Part B if you're first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>However, home companions (same-gender and reverse-gender) are often not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These individuals are suggested to contact Social Security three months before turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.

I will retire from my giant employer on June 30, 2020 and that would be the final day of my health coverage via my employer.<p>
