<p> Medicare Advantage plans are a substitute for Original Medicare.

Beneficiaries with diagnoses of ESRD usually incur greater costs than the common beneficiary, and CMS is making these changes to out-of-pocket maximums to raised reflect beneficiary spending.<p>
<p>The basic enrollment period for Original Medicare is from January 1 through March 31 of each yr.
