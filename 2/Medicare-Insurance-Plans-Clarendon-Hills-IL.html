For many years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has posted high quality ratings of Medicare Advantage plans to supply beneficiaries with additional information about plans supplied in their area. Prior authorization is most often required for relatively expensive companies, such as inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, but sometimes required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can also require enrollees to make use of “step therapy” for Part B medicine, which means that they are required to try some particular drugs before they obtain approval to attempt different medication.
