<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare solely during the Medicare basic enrollment interval . Generally, if a person continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later during a SEP. For example, employer coverage for retirees or via COBRA doesn’t depend as current employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
