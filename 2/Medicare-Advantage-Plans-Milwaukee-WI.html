<p>If you don’t take many prescribed drugs, look for a plan with a low monthly premium. All plans should nonetheless cover most medication used by people with Medicare. If, then again, you could have excessive prescription drug costs, check into plans that cover your drugs in thedonut gap, the coverage gap interval that kicks in after you and the plan have spent $4,020 on lined medicine in 2020.

If you’re approaching retirement, likelihood is you’ve already received a monetary plan mapped out that will help you smoothly transition from full-time work to a life of leisure. Unfortunately, even the best-laid plans can collapse when circumstances change.

As of 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been allowed to cover a broader vary of extra benefits, together with issues like home health aides, medical transportation, and the set up of in-home safety units.
