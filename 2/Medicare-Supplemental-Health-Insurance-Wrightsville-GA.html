NoteEach 12 months, plans set the amounts they cost for premiums, deductibles, and companies. The plan decides how much you pay for the lined services you get.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw again” the amount it paid on your care when it finds out.

Though you don’t have to enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage through a certified group health plan, doing so might make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>
