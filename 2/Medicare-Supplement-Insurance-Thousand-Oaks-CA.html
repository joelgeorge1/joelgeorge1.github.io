<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
