The Medicare version of your current plan may have different benefits, doctors, service areas and behavioral health providers than the non-Medicare model.<p>
<p>Even should you use considered one of these different cards, you also may be requested to show your Medicare card, so hold it with you. Be positive to carry your card with you whenever you’re away from residence. Let your doctor, hospital, or different health care provider see your card when you want hospital, medical or different health companies.
