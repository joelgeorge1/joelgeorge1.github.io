If you enroll in both Part A and Part B, you might choose to apply for a Medicare Advantage , Medicare Prescription Drug , or Medicare Supplement plan. You also can apply for a Part D plan should you solely enroll in Medicare Part B during your IEP.<p>

<p>Enrolling in a brand new plan instantly via Medicare is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself if there are problems with enrollment. Write down every thing concerning the conversation whenever you enroll by way of Medicare, including the date, the consultant you spoke to, and any outcomes or subsequent steps. If you are dissatisfied with your coverage for subsequent 12 months, make changes throughout Fall Open Enrollment.<p>
<p>Starting Medicare Part B at the right time can help ensure that you've got robust health coverage on the lowest cost to you.
