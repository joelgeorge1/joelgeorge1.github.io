<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

If you and/or your family members are coated beneath a UC worker plan or enrolled in TRICARE for Life, Medicare might be secondary to your UC medical plan.<p>
