<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage via them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
