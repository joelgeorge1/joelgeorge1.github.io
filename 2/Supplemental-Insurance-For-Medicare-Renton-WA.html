<p>If you are not signing up for Medicare at 65 and at present have company supplied group coverage, are you required to verify this with Medicare? What I am attempting to clarify is what exactly do you should do to avoid these penalties for not signing up you check with.

Hi Marcia, Both you and your husband should consider enrolling for Medicare Part B proper when he retires. You are taking a threat delaying Part B because once he retires Medicare is his major insurance, whatever the variety of staff at his agency and whether or not you’re actually enrolled.<p>
