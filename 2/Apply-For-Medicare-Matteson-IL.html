You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
