<p>Yes, you can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and stop paying premiums on your present insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies whenever you join Medicare after age 65.

<h2>Medicare Supplements and Medicare Advantage Plans Explained in Ft Mitchell KY</h2>
<p>You can add a Medicare Supplement plan and/or a standalone Medicare Prescription Drug plan to Original Medicare (Parts A & B).

The Special Enrollment Period enables you to enroll in Original Medicare outside of your IEP because of certain life changes. For example, you may wait to enroll when you're still working.<p>
<p>Within states, Medicare Advantage penetration varies extensively across counties. For instance, in Florida, sixty six % of all beneficiaries living in Miami-Dade County are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans whereas only 10 p.c of beneficiaries living in Monroe County do so.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw again” the quantity it paid for your care when it finds out. At that point, you would wish to enroll in Part B, but would possibly no longer qualify for the SEP should you delayed enrolling for more than 8 months. If you’re satisfied together with your present Medicare plan, you don’t need to take any action. However, plan details can change annually, so you might need to compare your plan options for each to confirm your health and prescription drug needs are lined by your plan for the following 12 months.
