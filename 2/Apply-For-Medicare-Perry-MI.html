<h3>Are You Buying The Right Health Insurance Plan in Perry?</h3>
<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium in your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans often even have higher deductibles, so you need to carefully compare these plans with your earnings before you decide. Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check the entire Medicare options in your space.

<p>Medicare open enrollment – also referred to as Medicare’s annual election interval – runs from October 15 through December 7 annually.
