<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
