<p>A rebate cannot contribute to "profit" ("revenue" is in quotes because most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-revenue organizations, primarily integrated health supply systems). In 2017, the average out-of-pocket limit for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the same as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $four,313 in 2011 . HMO enrollees have typically had lower out-of-pocket limits than enrollees in native PPOs or regional PPOs, and this remains the case in 2017. More than half of all enrollees (fifty two%) are in plans with limits above $5,000 in 2017, similar to 2016.<p>
