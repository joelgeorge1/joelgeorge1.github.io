<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at sixty five and at present have company supplied group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?

<p>Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers hundreds of thousands of people and entails a good larger number of healthcare suppliers and services.

The program helps with the cost of health care, however it does not cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-time period care.
