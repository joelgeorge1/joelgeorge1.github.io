The Part C threat adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans could cover benefits in a different way. For example, plans that require larger out-of-pocket prices than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, may provide lower copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits bundle.<p>

Many individuals determine to pair original Medicare with a supplemental coverage — called Medigap — to assist cover out-of-pocket prices such as deductibles and coinsurance. You cannot, however, pair a Medigap policy with an Advantage Plan.<p>
