<h3>Medicare Beneficiaries Hugo Oklahoma 74743</h3>
<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
