Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively costly companies, such as inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, but occasionally required for preventive companies. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can also require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B medication, meaning that they are required to attempt some specific drugs before they receive approval to attempt other drugs.
