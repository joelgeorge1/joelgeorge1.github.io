<p>Third, individuals who live in two totally different geographical areas of the nation at totally different instances of the year (principally so-referred to as snowbirds) discover it difficult to reside with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C threat adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans could cover benefits in a different way. For instance, plans that require higher out-of-pocket prices than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, may offer lower copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits package.<p>

You can delay benefits all the way till age 70 and maintain boosting them within the process.<p>
