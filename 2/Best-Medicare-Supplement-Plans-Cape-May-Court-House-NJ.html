<p>If you enroll in Medicare in the course of the January – March General Enrollment interval, you'll be able to enroll in Part D between April 1 and June 30. But Medicare Part B has a month-to-month premium — projected to be about $153.30/month in 2021 — which might be deducted out of your Social Security or Railroad Retirement check. You’re eligible to enroll in Medicare Part D so long as you could have both Medicare Part A or Part B.<p>
<p>These plans can be HMOs, PPOs, Regional PPOs or Private Fee-for-Service plans. MA plans can resolve each year whether or not to offer an MA plan and may discontinue the plan after providing their enrollees with notice.

People who're eligible for Medicare based on disability could also be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period based mostly on their or their partner’s present employment. They could also be eligible based on a partner or member of the family’s current employment if the employer has 100 or more employees.<p>
<p>Be sure to think about how you may pay for the things Medicare would not cover. For instance, it usually doesn't cover dental work and routine imaginative and prescient or listening to care. Same goes for lengthy-time period care, beauty procedures and — for the jet-setters — medical care abroad.
