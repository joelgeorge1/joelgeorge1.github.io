<p>These earnings limits apply in 2020, and are indexed for inflation. There is no longer a donut gap by way of the utmost quantity that enrollees could be charged when they fill prescriptions. But the donut gap still exists by way of how insurers design their coverage , how total drug costs are counted, and who covers the majority of the cost of the medicine (the drug plan versus the producer; see Figure four here).<p>
<p>It may even be important to grasp the implications for beneficiaries in each Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare, when it comes to costs, benefits, premiums, quality of care, affected person outcomes, and access to suppliers.
