Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare version or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn 65, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>
<p>If the plan would not cover your present physicians, make certain that its medical doctors are acceptable to you and are taking new patients covered by the plan.
