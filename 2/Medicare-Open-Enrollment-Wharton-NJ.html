If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B.

Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare version or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan whenever you flip sixty five, once Medicare has approved your enrollment form.<p>

After paying into Medicare through payroll withholdings at work for many years, some folks strategy their eligibility age of sixty five with a false impression that their coverage shall be free.
