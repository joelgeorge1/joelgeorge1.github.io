<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.
