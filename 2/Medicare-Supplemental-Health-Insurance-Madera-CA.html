<p>Plan costs are sometimes lower than those of other Medicare Advantage plan types, but you’re normally limited to docs in the plan’s provider community. Medicare Advantage plans may provide further (“supplemental”) benefits that aren't supplied in conventional Medicare, and may use rebate dollars to help cover the cost of extra benefits.
