As a result of these selections, you might have differences in your Medicare benefits. There are 4 “parts” to the Medicare insurance program, each offering a certain set of Medicare benefits.<p>
<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be automatically enrolled. You can sign up for or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration immediately.<p>
