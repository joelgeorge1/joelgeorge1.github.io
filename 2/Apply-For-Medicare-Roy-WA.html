<p>You could not have to pay a late enrollment penalty if you enroll during a specialty enrollment interval in Roy. If you are turning 65 – but you’re not yet receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits – you won’t be automatically enrolled in Original Medicare.

<h2>The Truth About Medicare Advantage in Roy WA</h2>
<p>The only exception is if you’re contributing to a health savings account and wish to proceed doing so. Medicare enrollees aren't allowed to contribute to an HSA, even when they continue to have coverage underneath an employer’s HSA-certified high-deductible health plan. That mentioned, it often pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even if you have health coverage already. It won’t cost you anything, and this way, Medicare can serve as your secondary insurance and doubtlessly pick up the tab for anything your primary insurance doesn’t cover. If you do not sign up for Part B whenever you're first eligible, you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>If you enroll in the course of the general enrollment interval, your coverage will take impact July 1. If you didn’t enroll in Medicare when you had been first eligible, you cannot use the autumn open enrollment period to enroll.<p>

During the first yr a person is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, they can change to Original Medicare and a Part D plan. And with some exceptions, they also have assured-problem entry to a Medigap plan. Switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage (so long as you’re enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B, and you live in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service space).<p>
