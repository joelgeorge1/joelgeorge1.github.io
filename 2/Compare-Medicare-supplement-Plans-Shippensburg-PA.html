Krugman cites all the familiar figures from the remainder of the developed world, the place some mixture of public insurance with some private parts manages to cover almost everyone and at a much lower cost than in the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this nation by the private corporate interests who profit from the costly mess of a health care system we've now.
