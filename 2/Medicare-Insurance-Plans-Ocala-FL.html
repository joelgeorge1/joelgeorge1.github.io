If you are turning 65 – but you’re not but receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits – you gained’t be automatically enrolled in Original Medicare. Instead, you’ll have the ability to enroll during a seven-month enrollment period that includes the three months earlier than your delivery month, the month you turn sixty five, and the three following months.

If you want pharmaceuticals, you would need to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

But you can find yourself paying higher out-of-pocket prices all year long. Private Medicare Advantage plans is usually a good deal for seniors in search of all-in-one medical and drug coverage.
