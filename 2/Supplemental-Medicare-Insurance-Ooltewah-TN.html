However, UC does require that you simply ship in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare model or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you flip sixty five, once Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>

For example, employer coverage for retirees or via COBRA doesn’t count as present employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
<p>If you are eligible for premium-free Part A and you don’t enroll in Part A and B before your sixty fifth birthday, you could lose your UC-sponsored medical coverage and be charged penalties by RASC and lifelong penalties by Medicare.
