<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to.

You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
