<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Is the 6 month retroactive interval for medicare from the day medicare coverage begins or the day you apply for medicare coverage. Do I even have to cease HSA contributions on April 1 or May 1 (6 months again from date coverage starts.<p>

Work along with your main care provider and your loved ones to decide on a plan that you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use probably the most.
