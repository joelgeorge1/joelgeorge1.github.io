<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months should you don’t need to.

You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
