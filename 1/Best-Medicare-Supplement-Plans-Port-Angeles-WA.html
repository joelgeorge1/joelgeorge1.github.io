A lot of us go months without checking on our super balance, however there are a few reasons why you need to be checking yours in the meanwhile.<p>
<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether and the way it pays in the event that they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B.

Sending in the info by this date permits for the well timed processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days earlier than your sixty fifth birthday, RASC will ship you a letter with information about enrolling in Medicare. Remember, you and/or your partner can hold off on enrolling in Medicare as long as you’re working — just make sure to enroll if you retire.<p>
