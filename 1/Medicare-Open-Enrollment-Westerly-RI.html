<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
