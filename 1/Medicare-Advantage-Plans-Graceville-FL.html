<p>But 15 % of all Medicare beneficiaries are under sixty five, and became eligible after receiving Social Security disability benefits for two years or being recognized with ALS or end-stage renal disease. During the first yr a person is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, they can swap to Original Medicare and a Part D plan. And with some exceptions, additionally they have guaranteed-problem entry to a Medigap plan. Switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage (as long as you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B, and you live in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service space).<p>
<p>Instead, you’ll receive a invoice for Medicare Part B for as long as you aren’t but accumulating Social Security. If you enroll in Medicare Part A, you’ll have to cease contributing to your HSA.<p>
