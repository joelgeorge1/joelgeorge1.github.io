If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

If your Medicare coverage has began and you want to drop Part B, contact Social Security for instructions on how to submit a signed request. Your coverage will end the primary day of the month after Social Security gets your request.
