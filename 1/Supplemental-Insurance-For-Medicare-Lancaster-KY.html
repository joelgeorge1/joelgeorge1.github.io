<p>Also, individuals who qualify for the total Low-Income Subsidy may have their prescription drugs covered by a Medicare Part D plans at a very low price. For occasion, the co-payment is $1.30 for generic medicines and for model-name medications $3.ninety in 2020 and $4.00 in 2021 for individuals at or below 100% FPL.

Medical Savings Account plans MSA plans combine a high-deductible health plan with a special savings account.<p>
<p>If you qualify, you can return to Original Medicare or be part of, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you select to return to Original Medicare in this qualifying event, you may also apply for a Medicare Supplement plan.
