<p>But these averages mask broad regional and useful differences. Just as crucial benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the main determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the size of that protection. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend greater than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical companies; it's plans with this limit that have the bottom premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 annually but of course -- for these plans -- the premium is greater.

In this example, you would possibly pay your Part B month-to-month premium, plus 30%, for as long as you have Part B. If you’re not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you will want to sign up for it whenever you first turn into eligible to do so.<p>
