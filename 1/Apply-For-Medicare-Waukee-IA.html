<p>However, domestic companions (identical-gender and opposite-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are suggested to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The rules are different for workers and retirees; so to make sure you enroll properly, avoid Medicare premium penalties and perceive how Medicare works together with your UC-sponsored medical plan, observe these steps. If you don't make any changes during AEP, your current plan will routinely renew the next 12 months.
