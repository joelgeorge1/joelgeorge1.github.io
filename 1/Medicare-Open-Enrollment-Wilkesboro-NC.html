You’re eligible to enroll in Medicare Part D so long as you've either Medicare Part A or Part B.<p>

<p>Whether you even have coverage via your employer has no bearing on whether you’ll pay a premium for Medicare.

Your initial window to enroll is the seven-month period that begins three months earlier than the month of your sixty fifth birthday and ends three months after it. Seniors are typically suggested to sign up on time to keep away from penalties that could show quite pricey over the course of retirement.<p>
