If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B.

Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare model or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn sixty five, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>
