<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage.

Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and whole estimated costs for individuals like your self.
