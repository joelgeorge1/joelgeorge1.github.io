You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
