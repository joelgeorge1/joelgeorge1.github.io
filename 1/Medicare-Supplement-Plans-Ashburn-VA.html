<p>The Medicare Rights Center was not capable of affirm that all ministries work this fashion, but it might be clever for you to think about that your ministry has such a requirement.

If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your main card for Medicare—you should still keep and use it everytime you want care. And, in case you have a Medicare drug plan, make sure to keep that card as nicely.<p>
