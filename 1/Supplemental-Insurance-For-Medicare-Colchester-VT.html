<p> The Medicare Advantage program gives people an alternative means of receiving their Medicare benefits. The program consists of many different health plans which might be regulated by Medicare but run by private insurance corporations. Plans often charge month-to-month premiums , though some plans in some areas are available with zero premiums.

<p>Third, people who live in two different geographical areas of the country at different times of the yr (principally so-referred to as snowbirds) find it troublesome to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C danger adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits another way.
