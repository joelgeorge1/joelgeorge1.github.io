Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check the entire Medicare options in your space. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and total estimated prices for individuals like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay when you see the physician.<p>

Work together with your main care provider and your loved ones to decide on a plan that you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use the most. Advantage plans limit what you possibly can pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
