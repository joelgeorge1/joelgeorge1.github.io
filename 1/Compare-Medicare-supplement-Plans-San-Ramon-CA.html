You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers millions of individuals and involves an even greater number of healthcare suppliers and companies.
