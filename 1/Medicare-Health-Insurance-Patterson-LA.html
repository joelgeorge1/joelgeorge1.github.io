But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check along with his group plan to see what their specific guidelines are.

Just as crucial advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the main determinant of monthly premium variations is the size of that protection.
