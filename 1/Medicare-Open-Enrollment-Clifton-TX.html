<p>Many staff are entitled to choose the fund employers pay their super contributions into. My employer must pay super and I want to know if it may be paid to where my super is now.

<h3>Medicare Supplement Plan G Clifton Texas 76634</h3>
<p>Be sure to be aware that when he does take Social Security, he might be enrolled in Part A, efficient six months retroactively. Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the 12 months, which may lead to penalties.
