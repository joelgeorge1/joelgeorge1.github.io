<p>Be positive to be aware that when he does take Social Security, he will be enrolled in Part A, effective six months retroactively. Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the yr, which might result in penalties. It would possibly ultimately make sense to keep Medicare Part B even when your plan switches back and forth between primary coverage, simply to avoid uncertainty. That stated, you need to qualify for Special Enrollment into Part B should you do decide to delay enrollment.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it once you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment period that lasts eight months.
