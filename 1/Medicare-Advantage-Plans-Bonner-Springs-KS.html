<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

You can not contribute to an HSA when you’re on Medicare. Your preliminary window to enroll is the seven-month interval that begins three months earlier than the month of your sixty fifth birthday and ends three months after it.
