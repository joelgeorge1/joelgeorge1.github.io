<p>Yes, you possibly can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and cease paying premiums on your current insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies when you join Medicare after age sixty five. At that point, when you enroll, your coverage dates back to both six months, or your sixty fifth birthday — whichever is shorter. It doesn’t matter in case your employer has 20 full-time or part-time staff; the edge is 20 to be thought of a group health plan for Medicare special enrollment purposes.<p>

<h2>Medicare Supplement Plan in Waltham MA- Fills in the Gaps of Original Medicare</h2>

If somebody is eligible for free Part A as a result of age, he or she can enroll in Part A any time after they’re first eligible for Medicare in the course of the Initial Enrollment Period . An particular person could also be eligible for premium free Part A in the event that they or their partner paid Medicare taxes whereas working.<p>
<p>As a common rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 have to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage by way of them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
