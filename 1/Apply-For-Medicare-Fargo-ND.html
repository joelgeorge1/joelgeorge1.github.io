<p>Third, individuals who live in two totally different geographical areas of the nation at totally different occasions of the year (largely so-called snowbirds) discover it difficult to stay with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans might cover benefits in a different way. For instance, plans that require larger out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, corresponding to expert nursing facility care, may provide decrease copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits bundle.<p>
<p>But these averages masks wide regional and helpful variations.

Many folks determine to pair unique Medicare with a supplemental policy — known as Medigap — to help cover out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and coinsurance. You cannot, however, pair a Medigap coverage with an Advantage Plan.<p>
