<p>But you’ll still need to pay the federal government a premium for Part B, along with the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage (which may be $0, depending on the plan). Any time during the year, a person enrolled in Original Medicare can apply for a special Medigap plan. But if it’s not through the particular person’s one-time Medigap enrollment window, the insurer will doubtless use medical underwriting to find out whether or not to concern the policy and at what price.<p>

If someone is over the "full" Extra-Help limits, they may still take advantage of lowered month-to-month premiums (though not $zero) and also reduced prescription drug co-funds - depending on their financial resources.<p>
<p>If you enroll in Medicare through the January – March General Enrollment period, you'll be able to enroll in Part D between April 1 and June 30. But Medicare Part B has a monthly premium — projected to be about $153.30/month in 2021 — which will be deducted from your Social Security or Railroad Retirement check.
