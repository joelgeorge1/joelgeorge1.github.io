<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Since 2017, the average month-to-month Medicare Advantage premium has decreased by an estimated 34.2 %. This is the lowest that the common month-to-month premium for a Medicare Advantage plan has been since 2007.<p>
