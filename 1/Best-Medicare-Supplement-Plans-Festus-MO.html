Just as the most important advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the major determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the size of that safety.

Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 annually however in fact -- for these plans -- the premium is larger. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is usually reported.<p>
