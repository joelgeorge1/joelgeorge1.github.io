<p>I would suggest addressing that issue with a union consultant and going from there. Some individuals choose to pay for health coverage through an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a alternative then that’s something to first address with the entity that’s forcing you to acquire Medicare.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare solely during the Medicare common enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later throughout a SEP.

<p>Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage also handle payments to healthcare providers differently.
