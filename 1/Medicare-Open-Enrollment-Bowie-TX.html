The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between kinds of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how effective that equalization program is.

Depending on your income you may have to pay a further premium for Part D as nicely. If you’ll turn 65 within the subsequent calendar year, it's time to make some decisions.<p>
