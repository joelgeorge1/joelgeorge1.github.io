<p>Starting Medicare Part B at the proper time can help ensure that you've got sturdy health coverage at the lowest cost to you. Medicare Part B isn’t a legal requirement, and you don’t want it in some conditions. In general, when you’re eligible for Medicare and have creditable coverage, you can postpone Part B penalty-free. Creditable coverage contains the insurance offered to you or your spouse via work.<p>

If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you cease working, remember that this doesn’t count as coverage based on current employment; be sure to don’t wait till your COBRA benefits end to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>
