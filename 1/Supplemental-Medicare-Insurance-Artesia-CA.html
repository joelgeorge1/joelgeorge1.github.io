The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are routinely eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for instance, those that have worked or spouses have labored at least 10 years, or forty quarters, and paid Medicare taxes via their employment.

You should communicate together with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you understand how your current coverage works with Medicare and what the consequences could be should you drop Medicare Part B.<p>
