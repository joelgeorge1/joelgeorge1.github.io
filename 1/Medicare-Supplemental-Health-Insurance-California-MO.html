<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans usually even have larger deductibles, so you need to rigorously compare these plans with your income earlier than making a decision. Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your space.
