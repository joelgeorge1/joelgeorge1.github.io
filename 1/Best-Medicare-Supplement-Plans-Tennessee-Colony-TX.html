<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
