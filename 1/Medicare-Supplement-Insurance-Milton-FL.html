<p>You might not have to pay a late enrollment penalty should you enroll throughout a specialty enrollment interval in Milton. If you might be turning 65 – but you’re not yet receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits – you won’t be routinely enrolled in Original Medicare.

<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five need to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage through them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union legal guidelines mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
