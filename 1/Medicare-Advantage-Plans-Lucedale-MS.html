<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>Whether you even have coverage by way of your employer has no bearing on whether or not you’ll pay a premium for Medicare. You can qualify for special enrollment if the plan has fewer than 20 workers; Medicare will be major vs. secondary to the group health plan primarily based on the number of workers, though. You can not contribute to an HSA when you’re on Medicare.
