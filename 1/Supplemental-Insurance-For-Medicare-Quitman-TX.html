<p>As a general rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage by way of them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union legal guidelines mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>More than three million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Special Needs Plans .
