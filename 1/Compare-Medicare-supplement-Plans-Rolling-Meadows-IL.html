<p>The basic enrollment period for Original Medicare is from January 1 through March 31 of each year. Keep in mind that you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B when you didn't enroll if you have been first eligible. If you have health coverage via present employment (either by way of your work or your partner’s employer), you might decide to delay Medicare Part B enrollment.

<p>If you are not signing up for Medicare at sixty five and presently have company provided group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?

<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare only through the Medicare basic enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later during a SEP. For example, employer coverage for retirees or by way of COBRA doesn’t depend as current employment, so these individuals don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
<p>Medicare received’t reject your enrollment in case you have another health plan. But in your case, if you maintain your insurance via your job, Medicare will likely function your secondary insurance, and your employer’s insurance might be main.

Only give your Medicare Number to doctors, pharmacists, other health care suppliers, your insurers, or individuals you trust to work with Medicare on your behalf. If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your primary card for Medicare—you must nonetheless keep and use it whenever you want care. And, if you have a Medicare drug plan, make sure to hold that card as properly.<p>
