<p>Is the 6 month retroactive interval for medicare from the day medicare coverage begins or the day you apply for medicare coverage. Do I have to cease HSA contributions on April 1 or May 1 (6 months back from date coverage starts.<p>
<p>But should you enrolled in Medicare regardless of having health coverage, it leads me to imagine that your employer coverage left some gaps, which is why you selected Medicare. Either way, you could have the option to cease Medicare and sign up again whenever you want it. My husband is eligible for medicare in March but remains to be working full time and can proceed to take action till he is 70. I and our son are coated underneath his firm insurance which incorporates an HSA.<p>
