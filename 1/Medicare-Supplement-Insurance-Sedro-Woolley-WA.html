<p>As a common rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage by way of them because the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B.
