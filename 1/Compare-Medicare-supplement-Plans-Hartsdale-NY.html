However, UC does require that you ship in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your existing retiree plan has a Medicare version or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan whenever you flip 65, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>
