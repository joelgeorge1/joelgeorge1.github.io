<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans often also have larger deductibles, so you must rigorously compare these plans with your income before making a decision. Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area.

You typically will not have to pay a penalty when you later resolve to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and you haven't gone for longer than 63 continuous days without creditable coverage.<p>
