This comes with an employer request for info form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage by way of them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>
