Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively costly providers, similar to inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but sometimes required for preventive companies. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B medication, meaning that they're required to attempt some specific drugs earlier than they receive approval to attempt different medication.
